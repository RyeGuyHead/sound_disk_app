This is a little application I made with help from the Ruby on Rails Tutorial.

It is essentially aimed at being a community where like-minded people can talk about music and programming and such.

Still in its larvae stages, but sparks are flying(in my head) and I'm ready to get the ball rolling.

Figurative speech aside, check back later for updates.
