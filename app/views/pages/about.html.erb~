<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
Hello! My name is Ryan Johnson, and I created this site with help from
the Ruby on Rails tutorial and my time spent working with the Argo Navis
Consulting team. 
</p>

<p>
The hope of this site is to create a forum for users to talk about and share
their music of all shapes and styles. I have been a long time Newgrounder, and
my time there has highlighted the importance of feedback and collaboration in
terms of an audio standpoint. My goal is to make working and learning from otherartists as simple and fun as possible.
</p>

<p>
I will also use this space as a means of releasing some of my other coding
projects, in particular, my user-input music generator. As of now, it is in Java
and only plays audio as feedback. But I'm learning how to properly create a midifile, so a second version written in C++ will be available for open source download and collaboration within the next year.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for coming to my site, and I hope you enjoy your stay :)
